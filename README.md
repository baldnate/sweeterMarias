coffeePrices.py
===============

Screenscrapes the Sweet Maria's green coffee price listings, and outputs info about the prices.

This is current a WIP.  Output is CSV for the moment, and only has the coffee name and the price per pound for the various order sizes.

Wish list:
* Scrape the link and the description for each coffee
* Capture tags for each coffee
* Instead of outputting csv for Excel to work with, output a webpage that can do all the visualization I want.
