sweeterMarias - Archived
=============

sweeterMarias was an improved presentation of Sweet Maria's green coffee info.  Since I wrote this their website has changed significantly.  Those changes both broke this code, but also addressed the shortcomings this code was trying to remedy.

Structure
---------
The Python script scrapes the Sweet Maria's website and dumps the info in a json file.  The webpage allows interactive access to the coffee information.
